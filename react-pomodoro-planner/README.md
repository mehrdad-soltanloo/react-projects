# Daily Task Tracker

This is a React-based daily task tracker app consisting of four sections:

1. Pomodoro Timer: A 25-minute focus time followed by a 5-minute break.
2. Daily Progress: Displays a progress chart for up to 8 hours of daily work.
3. To-Do List: Allows users to add daily tasks and check them off as they are completed.
4. Task History: Displays the tasks completed yesterday (either based on the real date or the 8-hour work cycle).

# Features

- 25-minute focus sessions.
- 5-minute breaks.
- Ability to start, pause, and reset the timer.
- Tracks total focus time for the day.

2. Daily Progress:

- Progress bar to track focus time toward an 8-hour daily goal.
- Shows completed focus time for today and yesterday.

3. To-Do List:

- Check off completed tasks.
- Delete tasks.

4. Task History:

# Components Breakdown & Algorithm Explanation

1. Pomodoro Timer
   The Pomodoro Timer manages two sessions: focus time (25 minutes) and break time (5 minutes). The user can start, pause, and reset the timer, with session progress stored in localStorage.

- Initialize state for:

  - isRunning: whether the timer is active
  - secondsLeft: countdown timer for each session
  - isFocusSession: whether it's focus time (25 minutes) or break time (5 minutes)
  - completedFocusTime: total minutes of focus completed today

- On component mount:

  - Load any saved state (secondsLeft, isFocusSession, isRunning) from localStorage.

- Start Timer:

  - Set isRunning to true.
  - Start countdown using setInterval to decrease secondsLeft by 1 every second.

- Pause Timer:

  - Set isRunning to false, stopping the countdown.

- Reset Timer:

  - Set isRunning to false.
  - Set secondsLeft to 1500 (25 minutes).
  - Set isFocusSession to true (start with focus time).

- Session Switch (Focus/Break):

  - When secondsLeft reaches 0:
    - If it's focus time, add 25 minutes to completedFocusTime.
    - Switch session (focus to break or vice versa).
    - Reset secondsLeft (300 for break, 1500 for focus).

- Save state (isRunning, secondsLeft, isFocusSession, completedFocusTime) to localStorage after each change.

PomodoroTimer Component Flow

- startTimer: Starts the Pomodoro timer.
- pauseTimer: Pauses the current session.
- resetTimer: Resets the timer and switches back to focus mode.
- formatTime: Formats the time in minutes and seconds.

2. Daily Progress
   This section tracks and displays the user's progress toward an 8-hour daily goal using a progress bar. The total focus time is updated daily, and yesterday's focus time is displayed for reference.

- Initialize state for:

  - completedFocusTime: today's total focus time (in minutes).
  - yesterdayFocusTime: focus time completed yesterday.

- Calculate progress:

  - Use completedFocusTime to calculate percentage of the 8-hour goal (480 minutes).
  - Progress = (completedFocusTime / 480) \* 100.

- On component mount:
  - Check the current date:
    - If today is different from the last saved date:
      - Move today's completedFocusTime to yesterdayFocusTime.
      - Reset completedFocusTime to 0 for a new day.
    - Save today as lastSavedDate.

DailyProgress Component Flow

- calculateProgress: Returns the percentage of the daily 8-hour goal.
- useEffect: Checks if the current date has changed. If yes, updates yesterday’s focus time and resets today’s focus time.

3. To-Do List
   This section allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. All tasks are saved in localStorage for persistence.

- Initialize state for:

  - tasks: list of current tasks, each task contains:

    - id: unique identifier (generated by nanoid).
    - text: task description.
    - isCompleted: whether the task is done or not.

  - newTaskText: stores the input text for a new task.

- Add a Task:

  - Create a new task object with a unique ID, task text, and isCompleted set to false.
  - Add the new task to the task list and save it to localStorage.

- Toggle Task Completion:

  - Find the task by ID.
  - Toggle its isCompleted property (true/false).
  - Update tasks in localStorage.

- Delete Task:
  - Find the task by ID.
  - Remove it from the task list.
  - Save the updated list to localStorage.

TodoList Component Flow

- addTask: Adds a new task to the list.
- toggleTaskCompletion: Marks a task as completed or not.
- deleteTask: Removes a task from the list.

4. Task History
   This section displays a list of tasks that were completed yesterday. It retrieves the data from localStorage.

- Initialize state for:

  - yesterdayTasks: array of tasks completed yesterday, stored in localStorage.

- On component mount:
  - Load yesterday's tasks from localStorage.
  - Display each task, with a line-through for completed tasks.

TaskHistory Component Flow

- useEffect: Loads the tasks from localStorage when the component is mounted.
- The list is displayed with a strike-through for completed tasks.

## Dependencies

1. react-circular-progressbar: For the progress circles used in the Pomodoro Timer and Daily Progress sections.

```bash
npm install react-circular-progressbar
```

2. nanoid: For generating unique IDs for the to-do tasks.

```bash
npm install nanoid
```

## Conclusion

This project is a great tool to help users track their daily focus time, manage their tasks, and view progress toward their goals. The structure makes use of localStorage to persist data and ensure the app remains functional even after the page is refreshed. The Pomodoro Timer section helps maintain productivity by alternating between focus and rest periods.
