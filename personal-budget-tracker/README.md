First of all, you absolutely do not suck! Building a full application, even a relatively simple one like this, requires integrating multiple concepts at once—React components, state management, conditional rendering, and more. It’s entirely normal to feel challenged and to take some time to get comfortable with how everything connects. The fact that you're sticking with it and pushing yourself to understand is the most important part, and you’re clearly making progress!

A few additional tips for connecting the dots as you go:

Trace Data Flow: As you work, track how data moves from one component to another, from state to props, or through function calls. This will make it easier to see how each piece interacts.

Map Out Component Interactions: Before coding a feature, try sketching out a quick diagram of the components and how they relate to each other. This visual can help clarify what each part does and how they connect.

Reflect After Each Project: After completing a project, review how each component and function fit together to create the final app. Noticing these patterns will build your confidence.

1. re cretae the components one by one and make is simple first
2. use Feyman technique
3. write a comprehensive README and explain each part step by step

How to Approach This from Scratch
Let’s break it down into a process that builds up your understanding, component by component, and helps you connect the dots without feeling overwhelmed.

Step 1: Understand the App’s Core Structure
Define the Goal: This app is about tracking a budget and expenses. The main idea is that the user can:

Set a monthly budget (or income).
Add expenses with categories (like rent, groceries).
See a summary comparing their budget with total expenses.
Basic Structure of Components:

App: The main layout that holds everything together.
BudgetTracker: The central component that manages the state and contains the core parts (like the form, list of entries, and summary).
AddEntryForm: The form where the user adds a budget or expense entry.
EntriesList: Shows all entries (budget and expenses).
Summary: Shows totals and expense breakdowns.
Step 2: Build and Connect Components One-by-One
I’ll guide you through this in a sequence that will help reinforce each concept, starting with the simplest component and gradually layering on more functionality.

Step 3: Start Small – Just Render Basic Components First
Create a Basic App Component:

Start by creating App.jsx and render a BudgetTracker component inside.
Your first goal is just to display each component without functionality.
javascript
Copy code
import BudgetTracker from './components/BudgetTracker';

function App() {
return (

<div>
<BudgetTracker />
</div>
);
}

export default App;
Create an Empty BudgetTracker Component:

For now, let it just display headings for each of the parts.
javascript
Copy code
function BudgetTracker() {
return (

<div>
<h2>Budget Tracker</h2>
<h3>Add Entry Form</h3>
<h3>Entries List</h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
</div>
);
}

export default BudgetTracker;
See It Rendered:

At this point, you’re just setting up the shell, but seeing each heading rendered will give you a feel for how things are connected.
Step 4: Add Simple State Management in BudgetTracker
Now, add minimal state to BudgetTracker to manage entries.

javascript
Copy code
import { useState } from 'react';

function BudgetTracker() {
const [entries, setEntries] = useState([]);

return (

<div>
<h2>Budget Tracker</h2>
<h3>Add Entry Form</h3>
<h3>Entries List</h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
</div>
);
}

export default BudgetTracker;
At this stage, you have a state (entries) that will eventually hold each budget or expense entry. It’s empty now, but you’ll use it soon.
Step 5: Build AddEntryForm and Test Adding Entries
Create AddEntryForm with Basic Fields and handleSubmit:

Set up the form to handle basic inputs for type (budget or expense), amount, and date.
javascript
Copy code
import { useState } from 'react';

const AddEntryForm = ({ onAddEntry }) => {
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
type: '',
amount: '',
date: ''
});

const handleInputChange = (e) => {
const { name, value } = e.target;
setFormData((prev) => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));
};

const handleSubmit = (e) => {
e.preventDefault();
onAddEntry(formData);
setFormData({ type: '', amount: '', date: '' });
};

return (

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
<select name="type" value={formData.type} onChange={handleInputChange}>
<option value="">Select Type</option>
<option value="budget">Budget</option>
<option value="expense">Expense</option>
</select>
<input
        type="number"
        name="amount"
        placeholder="Amount"
        value={formData.amount}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
      />
<input
        type="date"
        name="date"
        value={formData.date}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
      />
<button type="submit">Add Entry</button>
</form>
);
};

export default AddEntryForm;
Add AddEntryForm to BudgetTracker and Test Data Flow:

Pass a function to AddEntryForm to handle the submission.
javascript
Copy code
import { useState } from 'react';
import AddEntryForm from './AddEntryForm';

function BudgetTracker() {
const [entries, setEntries] = useState([]);

const handleAddEntry = (newEntry) => {
setEntries((prevEntries) => [...prevEntries, newEntry]);
};

return (

<div>
<h2>Budget Tracker</h2>
<AddEntryForm onAddEntry={handleAddEntry} />
<div>
<h3>Entries List</h3>
{entries.map((entry, index) => (
<div key={index}>
{entry.type}: ${entry.amount} on {entry.date}
</div>
))}
</div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
</div>
);
}

export default BudgetTracker;
Test Adding Entries:

Try adding a few entries and see them appear in the list.
This should give you a sense of how data flows from AddEntryForm into BudgetTracker.
Step 6: Add Summary Component
Create Summary.jsx:

Summarize entries, showing total budget and total expenses.
javascript
Copy code
const Summary = ({ entries }) => {
const totalBudget = entries
.filter((entry) => entry.type === 'budget')
.reduce((acc, entry) => acc + parseFloat(entry.amount), 0);

const totalExpenses = entries
.filter((entry) => entry.type === 'expense')
.reduce((acc, entry) => acc + parseFloat(entry.amount), 0);

return (

<div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Total Budget: ${totalBudget}</p>
<p>Total Expenses: ${totalExpenses}</p>
</div>
);
};

export default Summary;
Add Summary to BudgetTracker:

Pass entries as a prop to Summary.
javascript
Copy code

<Summary entries={entries} />
Final Thoughts and Encouragement
Build Slowly: Take one small step at a time. Each component can be its own mini-project.
Test as You Go: Test each part before moving on. This will help you understand how everything connects.
Celebrate Small Wins: Every component you build and connect is a step forward. Don’t underestimate your progress.
If you stay consistent with this approach, you’ll absolutely start to see how everything connects. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck—you’re doing great!
