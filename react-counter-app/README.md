# React Counter App with Theme Switcher

## Introduction

This React Counter App is a simple project that demonstrates core React concepts, including component modularity, state management, event handling, and conditional styling. Users can increment, decrement, and reset the counter while toggling between light and dark themes.

## Project Structure and Components

Following Reactâ€™s modular principles, even simple applications benefit from splitting functionality into separate components. This app comprises three primary components:

1. **App Component**  
   The main component responsible for rendering `Counter` and `ThemeSwitcher`. It also manages the state of the counter and theme, which are passed as props to its child components.

2. **Counter Component**  
   Renders the counter UI with buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the count.

3. **ThemeSwitcher Component**  
   Renders a button to toggle the theme between light and dark modes.

### Why State is Managed in App Component

Managing `counter` and `theme` states in the `App` component has several advantages:

- **Single Source of Truth**: With both `counter` and `theme` managed in the `App` component, we maintain a single, reliable state source, making updates and debugging simpler.
- **Reusability**: Centralizing state in the parent component makes it easy to pass it down as needed to future components without duplicating state management.
- **Consistency and Predictability**: This structure ensures `Counter` and `ThemeSwitcher` are consistently synchronized with the latest state.
- **Scalability**: As the app grows, centralizing state in the parent allows for easy scaling and improved state management, potentially using tools like React Context or Redux.

## Component Breakdown

### Counter Component

The `Counter` component handles increment, decrement, and reset actions for the counter value.

```javascript
const Counter = ({ counter, setCounter }) => {
  const increment = () => setCounter((prev) => prev + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCounter((prev) => prev - 1);
  const reset = () => {
    if (counter === 0) return;
    setCounter(0);
  };

  return (
    <div className="counter-container">
      <h1>{counter}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Counter;
```

The reset button is set up to only reset the counter if it isnâ€™t already at 0, reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving UX.

## ThemeSwitcher Component

The ThemeSwitcher component allows users to toggle between light and dark themes, updating the theme based on the toggleTheme event handler.

```
const ThemeSwitcher = ({ toggleTheme, currentTheme }) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Switch to {currentTheme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"} theme
    </button>
  );
};
export default ThemeSwitcher;
```

The toggleTheme function is passed down from the App component, where it updates the theme state based on user interaction.

## Theme Management and Styling

1. Theme Classes in CSS:
   In index.css, .light and .dark classes define background and text colors for each theme.

2. Dynamic Class Assignment:
   The App component applies a theme class (either light or dark) to the main container dynamically. Using template literals, we apply the theme class conditionally, based on the theme state.

3. toggleTheme Function in App Component:
   The toggleTheme function is written with a functional setState to ensure accurate state updates, especially if multiple updates are triggered in quick succession.

```javascript
Copy code
const toggleTheme = () => {
setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
};
```

** Functional SetState: This ensures that any quick or asynchronous updates are handled correctly, always using the latest theme state for consistency.**
