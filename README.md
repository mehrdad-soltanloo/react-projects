# React Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **React Projects Portfolio**! This repository contains a collection of React projects organized by different topics, covering a range of skill levels from beginner to advanced. Each project is stored in its own folder and focuses on a specific aspect or feature of React development, providing a structured learning path to help me build and showcase my React skills.

## Repository Structure

Each project in this repository is stored in its own subfolder within the root directory. Projects are organized by topic and skill level, allowing for easy navigation and reference. The folder structure is as follows:

- **my-calculator-app**: A simple calculator built with React for basic arithmetic operations.
- **personal-budget-tracker**: A personal finance tracking app that allows users to manage income and expenses.
- **react-counter-app**: A counter app demonstrating state management with increment and decrement functionality.
- **react-pomodoro-planner**: A Pomodoro timer app for time management, built to practice handling timers and state in React.
- **task-master-plus**: A task management app for tracking to-do items, demonstrating CRUD operations.
- **to-do-app**: Another take on a to-do list application, focusing on dynamic list rendering and user interactions.

Feel free to explore each project folder to understand its purpose, code structure, and features. Each folder contains the necessary files to run the app locally, including dependencies, configurations, and a local `.gitignore` to handle project-specific ignores.

## Topics Covered

The projects in this repository cover a variety of topics in React, including but not limited to:

- **React Basics**: Building fundamental UI components, handling events, and managing state.
- **Hooks**: Leveraging `useState`, `useEffect`, and other React hooks for state and lifecycle management.
- **Routing**: Setting up client-side routing with React Router (in relevant projects).
- **Form Handling**: Managing form inputs, validation, and controlled components.
- **State Management**: Using hooks and context for managing complex state across components.
- **API Integration**: Fetching and displaying data from external APIs (in advanced projects).
- **Advanced Concepts**: Topics like performance optimization, lazy loading, and context-based state management.

Each project folder contains a README.md file with more specific setup instructions, if required.

## Goals and Learning Path

This repository is a curated collection of projects designed to progressively build expertise in React through hands-on practice. The projects are structured to reinforce core concepts and introduce advanced techniques, covering everything from foundational topics to complex features. By working through these projects, I am actively enhancing my React skills, including component design, state management, and hook usage, with the ultimate goal of building production-ready applications.

Each project demonstrates my commitment to mastering React and developing real-world, practical knowledge that prepares me to create efficient, maintainable applications.
